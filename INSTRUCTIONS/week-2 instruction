1. Remove hosts in the dataset that do not have all the 90 days of data
2. Without considering host, create a dataset of 90 days. Each day will have 50 features. However, each feature will be just sum of the same feature of all the hosts. Hint: load data in a pandas dataframe.
3. Play with PCA to see whether we can reduce the dimension.
